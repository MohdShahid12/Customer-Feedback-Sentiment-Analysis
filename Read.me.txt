We'll use the following libraries:

pandas for data manipulation
nltk for natural language processing
sklearn for machine learning
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
textblob for sentiment analysis.

3. Data Generation
We'll create a sample dataset of customer reviews with sentiments. For simplicity, we will simulate some customer feedback data.


4. Data Cleaning
We'll remove any missing values and ensure the data is in a proper format.

5. Text Preprocessing
We'll convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, and tokenize the words.

6. Sentiment Analysis
We will use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of each review.

7. Common Issues Identification
We can identify common issues based on keywords in the reviews.

8.Visualization
We can visualize the sentiment scores and common issues.

9.Conclusion
